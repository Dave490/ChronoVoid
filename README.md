# ChronoVoid

This repository contains a small demo of a browser game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game is a simplified foundation for the **ChronoVoid: Legacy of Realms** concept. It features:

- Virtual joystick and buttons for touch support
- Basic player and enemy logic with wave-based spawning
- Minimal base building and time-freeze ability
- The base now starts with **20 resources**, allowing you to build a turret right away
- Turrets fire visible bullets and killing enemies yields additional resources
- A simple leaderboard records your highest wave when the player dies
- Local save system using `localStorage`

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run the demo. No build step is required.

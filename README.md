# ChronoVoid

This repository contains a small demo of a browser game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The game is a simplified foundation for the **ChronoVoid: Legacy of Realms** concept. It features:

- Virtual joystick and buttons for touch support
- Basic player and enemy logic with wave-based spawning
- Minimal base building and time-freeze ability
- Local save system using `localStorage`

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run the demo. No build step is required.
